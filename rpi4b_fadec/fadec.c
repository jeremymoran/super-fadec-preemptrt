 * FADEC Real-Time Data Port (RTDP) master — Raspberry Pi 4B
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * ///////
 * This program runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B and acts as the "master" controller
 * that reads live ADC (analogue-to-digital converter) data from up to six
 * RP2350 slave microcontroller boards.  Each slave board contains an
 * ADS131M08 8-channel 24-bit ADC and streams its most recent sample set
 * over an RS-485 serial bus using the SPI protocol.
 *
 * HOW THE HARDWARE TALKS
 * //////////////////////
 * 1. Each slave asserts its DATA_RDY (DRDY) GPIO pin HIGH when a fresh
 *    16-byte sample frame is ready to be read.
 * 2. This program detects that rising edge and immediately pulls the
 *    slave's Chip Select (CS) line LOW (CS is "active low" — LOW means
 *    "talk to me").
 * 3. The Pi then clocks 13 bytes out of the SPI bus.  The slave puts the
 *    data on MISO; the Pi ignores MOSI (we send zeros).
 * 4. After the transfer the Pi releases CS (back to HIGH) so the bus is
 *    free for the next slave.
 * 5. Byte 0 is a 0xEB sync header.  The remaining 12 bytes contain four
 *    24-bit signed integers (big-endian, MSB first), sign-extended to
 *    int32_t on decode.  Frames whose header byte is not 0xEB are dropped.
 *
 * TWO-THREAD ARCHITECTURE
 * ///////////////////////
 * The program uses two POSIX threads (pthreads) pinned to isolated CPU
 * cores so they never interfere with each other or with the Linux kernel:
 *
 *   Thread        Core   Priority           Job
 *   ///////////   ////   ////////////////   ////////////////////////////
 *   acq_thread     1     SCHED_FIFO / 99    Waits for DRDY edges, does
 *                        (highest RT)        SPI reads, pushes frames
 *                                            into the ring buffer.
 *   proc_thread    2     SCHED_FIFO / 50    Pops frames from the ring
 *                        (lower RT)          buffer, decodes them, prints
 *                                            results and statistics.
 *
 * The ring buffer (defined in fadec.h) is a lock-free single-producer /
 * single-consumer queue that lets the two threads exchange data without
 * any mutexes (locks), which would introduce unpredictable latency.
 *
 * REQUIRED BOOT OPTION (isolate cores 1 and 2 from Linux scheduling)
 * ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

     * DIRECT GPIO REGISTER MAPPING — THE KEY TO HIGH-SPEED OPERATION
     * //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
     *
     * WHY THE PREVIOUS LIBGPIOD APPROACH WAS SLOW (~800 Hz observed,
     * 32000 Hz expected):
     *
     * Problem 1 — CS toggling via gpiod_line_request_set_value():
     *   This function makes a write() syscall to /dev/gpiochip0.
     *   On Pi 4 each call takes ~50 µs.  With two calls per frame
     *   (assert + deassert) that alone caps throughput at ~10,000 Hz
     *   before the SPI transfer is even counted.
     *
     * Problem 2 — DRDY detection via gpiod edge events:
     *   gpiod_line_request_wait_edge_events() uses poll() on the GPIO
     *   character device.  The kernel's event FIFO has a small default
     *   capacity.  At 32 kHz it fills in ~500 µs.  If our loop takes
     *   longer than that, events are silently dropped — we were seeing
     *   only ~2,100 out of ~86,000 expected events (97.5% loss).
     *
     * FIX — direct memory-mapped register access:
     *   /dev/gpiomem exposes the BCM2711 GPIO hardware registers directly.
     *   Reading or writing a register is a single 32-bit AXI bus operation
     *   that takes < 1 ns — no syscall, no kernel round-trip.
     *
     *   We use three registers (all at byte offsets from the GPIO base,
     *   converted to uint32_t array indices by dividing by 4):
     *
     *   GPLEV0  (offset 0x34) — read all pin levels simultaneously
     *   GPSET0  (offset 0x1C) — write 1 to a bit to drive that pin HIGH
     *   GPCLR0  (offset 0x28) — write 1 to a bit to drive that pin LOW
     *
     *   For GPSET0/GPCLR0, bits you write 0 to are ignored (other pins
     *   are not affected), so we can safely set/clear individual pins
     *   with a single 32-bit write.
     *
     * COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
     *   We still use libgpiod to configure all GPIO directions and biases
     *   at startup (input with pull-down for DRDY, output for CS/DE/REN).
     *   The libgpiod handles are kept open so the kernel driver maintains
     *   those configurations.  We simply bypass the gpiod API for the
     *   actual hot-path read/write operations.
     *
     *   mmap offset must be 0 — /dev/gpiomem maps the GPIO register block
     *   starting from register 0; GPIO_BASE (0xFE200000) is a physical
     *   address, not a file offset, and must not be used here.
